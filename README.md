# arduino-woodhack

interactive and LED stripe code for hardware parts of installation made of wood, flotsam, and electronics.
Thanks to [@tilmanjusten](https://github.com/tilmanjusten) for quickling providing a working code base and bringing all of the electronic hardware.
I mostly did the LED animation part (ledstripe.ino).
